Sunday evenings used to fill me with dread. The weekend slipping away, the week ahead looming. Then I started treating Sunday differently—not as the end of rest, but as preparation for what's coming.

Self-care isn't bubble baths and face masks (though those are nice). It's intentionally doing things that fill you back up so you can show up for your life.

## Why Sunday Works

There's something about Sunday that lends itself to slowness. The week hasn't started its demands yet. You have space to breathe, reflect, and prepare.

But if Sunday doesn't work for you—maybe it's your busiest day, or you work weekends—pick another day. The specific day matters less than the consistency.

## Morning: Start Slow

Resist the urge to immediately check your phone. Those first moments of consciousness set the tone.

**A gentle morning routine:**

1. **Wake naturally if possible** — Even 20 minutes without an alarm feels different
2. **Stretch in bed** — Nothing fancy, just move your body before standing
3. **Drink water** — Your body has been without it for hours
4. **Sit quietly** — Even five minutes of stillness before the day begins

If you pray Fajr, you already have this built in. Use the time after prayer to sit a bit longer instead of rushing back to sleep or grabbing your phone.

## Mid-Morning: Nourish Your Body

Sunday breakfast should feel different from weekday grab-and-go meals.

**Ideas that feel special but aren't complicated:**
- Eggs however you like them, eaten at the table
- Oatmeal with actual toppings you enjoy
- Fresh fruit you took time to cut up
- Tea or coffee in your favorite cup, not a travel mug

Eat without scrolling. Taste your food. Notice when you're full.

## Late Morning: Move

Your body has been still for much of the week (let's be honest). Movement isn't about burning calories—it's about feeling alive in your body.

**Movement that doesn't feel like punishment:**
- A walk outside, even just around the block
- Gentle yoga or stretching
- Dancing to music in your room
- Swimming if you have access

The goal is to move until you feel better, not until you're exhausted. Twenty minutes is enough. Forty is great. Whatever you can do.

## Afternoon: The Practical Care

This is when the actual "taking care of things" happens. Not chores—personal maintenance that often gets skipped during busy weeks.

### Skincare Reset

Give your skin more attention than usual:
- Double cleanse to really clear everything out
- Exfoliate (gently)
- Apply a face mask while you do other things
- Massage in your moisturizer instead of rushing

### Hair Care

If you didn't wash your hair earlier in the week, Sunday is good for:
- A deep conditioning treatment
- Scalp massage with oil
- Detangling without rushing
- Trying a protective style for the week ahead

### Body Care

The parts of your body you usually ignore:
- Exfoliate rough areas (elbows, knees, heels)
- Actually moisturize everywhere after your shower
- Trim and file your nails
- Whatever else you've been meaning to do

Put on comfortable clothes afterward. Not pajamas you'll sleep in later—actual comfortable clothes that make you feel put-together at home.

## Late Afternoon: Feed Your Mind

Your brain needs input that isn't work emails or social media drama.

**Options:**
- Read something you actually want to read
- Listen to a podcast that teaches you something
- Watch a documentary
- Write in a journal
- Learn something new (a language app, a craft tutorial, anything)

This isn't about productivity. It's about giving your mind something nourishing instead of numbing.

## Evening: Prepare for the Week

A little Sunday preparation prevents Monday chaos.

**Practical prep:**
- Look at your calendar for the week
- Plan your outfits (or at least check that your go-to pieces are clean)
- Prep some food if that helps your week run smoother
- Pack your bag for tomorrow
- Set out what you need for morning

**Mental prep:**
- Write down three things you want to accomplish this week
- Identify what might be stressful and think through how you'll handle it
- Set an intention—not a goal, just a way you want to show up

## Night: Wind Down Intentionally

The quality of your Sunday sleep affects your Monday morning.

**Two hours before bed:**
- Dim the lights in your space
- Stop looking at screens (or at least use night mode)
- Avoid heavy food or caffeine
- Do something calming—read, stretch, talk with family

**One hour before bed:**
- Take a warm shower or bath
- Do your evening skincare slowly
- Pray Isha and any extra prayers you want to add
- Get into bed before you're exhausted

**In bed:**
- No phone
- Reflect on something good from the day
- Make dua for the week ahead
- Let yourself fall asleep without forcing it

## Making It Sustainable

You won't do all of this every Sunday. Life happens. Kids get sick, emergencies arise, sometimes you're just too tired.

**The minimum viable self-care Sunday:**
- One slow meal eaten without distractions
- Some kind of movement, even brief
- One thing that's just for you, not for anyone else
- Going to bed on time

That's it. If you can do that, you've reset. Everything else is bonus.

## What Self-Care Isn't

Let's be clear about what we're not talking about:
- Buying things to feel better (temporary)
- Ignoring responsibilities (that creates more stress)
- Elaborate rituals you can't maintain (unsustainable)
- Doing what influencers say instead of what you need (disconnected)

Real self-care sometimes looks like having a hard conversation, saying no to something, going to bed early instead of watching another episode, or sitting with uncomfortable feelings instead of distracting yourself.

## The Permission You Might Need

If you grew up being told that taking time for yourself is selfish, hear this: you cannot pour from an empty cup. The people who depend on you need you to be filled up.

Taking Sunday (or any day) to care for yourself isn't indulgent. It's maintenance. It's how you keep going.

You matter. Your rest matters. Your joy matters.

Start this Sunday. Not perfectly—just intentionally. See how Monday feels different when you've actually rested instead of just waiting for the weekend to end.
